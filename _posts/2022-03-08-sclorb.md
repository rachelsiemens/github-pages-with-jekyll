title: Sclorb!

If you've never been, then try to imagine. It's just as good to think you've been to somewhere, then to actually experience the failure of reality. 
This doesn't work all the time though, because sometimes reality is very good. Better, even, than you could've imagined. But that is only because the imagination is limited by fear, fatigue, and other things (probably I don't know I'm not an imagination scientist.).
